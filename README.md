# DNNGP
Implementation of Deep Neural Network Gaussian Process from https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165 in Python

Contains a jupyter notebook demonstrating MNIST training and evaluation. Also added an 'approximation' feature which linearizes the kernel using an approximation. More details on this will come later

Currently not optimized for speed but more for experimental use. Planning on trying to implement in Pytorch as well
