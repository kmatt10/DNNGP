# DNNGP
Implementation of Deep Neural Network Gaussian Process from https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165 in Python

Contains a jupyter notebook demonstrating MNIST training and evaluation. Also added an 'approximation' feature which linearizes the kernel using an approximation. More details on this will come later
